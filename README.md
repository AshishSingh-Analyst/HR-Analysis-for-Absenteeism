# HR-Analysis-for-Absenteeism
The project aims to use employee data to promote a healthy lifestyle among employees. It involves building a database, developing SQL queries, performing analysis, connecting the database to a data visualization tool like Power BI, and creating a dashboard based on an approved wireframe from the HR department.

HR has requested the following:

Providing a list of healthy individuals with low absenteeism for a healthy bonus program, with a $1000 bonus for each eligible employee.
Calculating the wage increase or annual compensation for non-smokers, with an insurance budget of $983,221 for all non-smokers.
Creating a dashboard to help HR understand absenteeism at work based on an approved wireframe.
To accomplish this:

Initiate Microsoft SQL Server Studio and connect to the local machine using Windows login credentials.
Create a new database.
Develop SQL queries to fulfill HR's requests.
Connect the database to a data visualization tool.
Create a dashboard based on the approved wireframe.
These steps will support HR initiatives related to promoting healthy lifestyles and managing absenteeism effectively.
